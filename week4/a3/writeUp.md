## Assignment 3, crowdwork ethnography.

Specifically, I’d like you to consider what ‘fairness’ means—to turkers themselves—in the context of Mechanical Turk work. When doing so, it may be useful to keep the following questions in mind as you perform the assignment:
What kinds of things do Mechanical Turkers consider to be fair, and unfair, about their work?
What kinds of Mechanical Turk tasks are considered to be unfair, and why?
What kinds of requester behaviors are considered to be unfair, and why?
What aspects of Amazon’s Mechanical Turk platform are considered to be unfair, and why?
What aspects of the Mechanical Turk Participation Agreement are considered to be unfair, and why?

With these ideas in mind, I would think what is fair to a turker are tasks that are easily accomplished and require little effort outside of a quick glance. Anything requiring more than a second per image is likely considered too much effort.


## types of HITs
- tracing objects (pay a lot, 60 cents per thing)
- filling out surveys (1 cent)

## Miscellaneous
- They can offer a bonus
- They sometimes require qualification
  - HIT approval rate above a threshold
  - Question editor has been granted?
  - Rates for other things, such as transcription review tasks
  - Custom qualifications (answering surveys or things to participate )


## General criteria for fairness
- 1) I want to find the problem interesting
- 2) I will likely do this based on how I value my time by converting hits to approximate dollars. Ex 1 cent per hit at one hit per second = 3600 cents per hour = 36 $/hr
- 3) If I have ethical dillemas with the activity I will likely object, consider it unfair / shouldnt happen


## reviewing ten HITs im fascinated in
- 1 https://worker.mturk.com/projects/3WY138MABE262CZBFQ9JOEFT00SIYM/tasks?ref=w_pl_prvw
  - why? submit art! fun! I can call myself a real artist
- 2 https://worker.mturk.com/requesters/A390LLXAEUY1J0/projects?ref=w_pl_prvw
  - why? what type of instagram account is this? Feel like it should be easy by glancing at it, low pay, but maybe easy enough
- 3 https://worker.mturk.com/requesters/AXFSE4LHLZGJ3/projects?ref=w_pl_prvw
  - This has  a LOT of HITs, why? It seems like it would easily take 20 seconds or more per linkedin profile, => 1.8$/hr.
- 4 https://worker.mturk.com/requesters/A2OYQV3KBEBVWN/projects?ref=w_pl_prvw
  - Natural language understanding for young kids, explaining a story to a small child? may be fun, plus decent pay
- 5 https://worker.mturk.com/requesters/A1Q6SJTRAZEIE6/projects?ref=w_pl_prvw
  -  decent pay and seems relatively easily
  - turns out this is harder than I thought. Definetly requires a good amount of brain power, didnt even pass the qualification test. Fair considering the pay seems good
- 6 https://worker.mturk.com/requesters/AG9MJLK2FDMMS/projects?ref=w_pl_prvw
  - This is one I think I would hate. Do some standardized test with a bonus? I dont know if bonuses are common, ive seen a few, but i distrust it immediately
  - if you dont get a bonus, you only get a cent, so im figuring its a way to weed out spammers, but i think it can be abused.
- 7 https://worker.mturk.com/requesters/A24RK7QQFRUIT3/projects?ref=w_pl_prvw
  - they want to know about resources in the u.s. What level of detail can they not get from online? Is it like a census for resources? pay is bad tho, i dont like it
- 8 https://worker.mturk.com/requesters/A1ZEEGMU3YMZ6/projects?ref=w_pl_prvw
  - Do i like an indie song or not? thats a good one, should get about .4 cents per second, which is better than a lot ive seen so far
- 9 https://worker.mturk.com/requesters/A2OR3N571JOX16/projects?ref=w_pl_prvw
  - It seems weird, you have to do a survey to qualify on a seperate site, but when I finished the survey it said the survey no longer existed. Was it just stealing data?
- 10 https://worker.mturk.com/projects/3P1CQ14RI9QVA948KAERJ7AMWXTDB8/tasks?ref=w_pl_prvw
  - Despite the low pay rate, I admire the transparency of these researchers.

## Previews of the ten hits in order
- 1 https://worker.mturk.com/projects/3WY138MABE262CZBFQ9JOEFT00SIYM/tasks?ref=w_pl_prvw
  - Its so wholesome! "It can be any type of art. For example; pencil, chalk, pen, digital app, a photo, or anything is ok, as long as YOU made it."
  - topic : How has political tyranny harmed you or someone you knew?
  - oof, im not sure about this. i guess existential threats on my sisters mental health?
  - I could see myself doing alot of these, it seems fun and relaxing
  - Purpose seems relatively clear. They claim its "This task is to encourage people to make art, so beginners are welcome and expected." I am unsure if this is true, or if its to gain some political or social traction by saying "we asked 1000 people for what they think political tyranny looks like, and this is what we found! America is evil!".
  - They ask for a first and last name, id definetly give fake information
- 2 https://worker.mturk.com/requesters/A390LLXAEUY1J0/projects?ref=w_pl_prvw
  - I was wrong, this would take quite a bit of time, id need to figure out the twitter and wikipedia entry for the type of instagram account it belongs to. There example involves finding the link and twitter of beyonce. This would take quite some time, and i doubt id do this for any period of time knowing by the end of an hour id only have a bit over a dollar or two on my name
  - It is straight forward, some concern that they may not pay me for all my labels if there were amibiguous labels. Ex gordon ramsey, is he a chef or is he a tv personality? I cant use both here.
  - This also isnt very fascinating. Id get bored and the motivation seems to be for some data agency to help with advertising or something.
- 3 https://worker.mturk.com/requesters/AXFSE4LHLZGJ3/projects?ref=w_pl_prvw
  - Requires an extension or use of a third party site to accomplish outside of linkedin
  - Why are we collecting this data? its for some business need, but unsure what business need this is. Headhunters?
  - Feels like im invading peoples privacy by collecting this data and handing it off to some strangers.
  - Funny thing is I talked about this with someone at the eScience Institute the other day, Varun Panicker. You cant crawl Linkedin with a script, or you get banned. Solutiong? Pay a ton of people next to nothing to collect it instead.
  - This circumvention goes to show why they ban people in the first place from scraping linkedin. ]
  - Overall something I would not participate it on a monetary and ethical standpoint
- 4 https://worker.mturk.com/requesters/A2OYQV3KBEBVWN/projects?ref=w_pl_prvw
  - Natural language understanding for young kids, explaining a story to a small child? may be fun, plus decent pay
  - Is a cool project, however it gives me an idea for how I could make money off this scheme.
  - They want humans to create generic forms of sentences you could have in stories
  - This would enable ML to create stories randomly from a series of generic sentences.
  - I could see some B.S. app with like "help your kid learn on their phone!" and youd just let kids read gibberish
  - perhaps im being too critical. It could be beneficial and seems like a cool problem.
  - Instructions are clear and very detailed https://docs.google.com/document/d/1W8S7y97G9yoAO5qVCHrBB7CTctVszTOrLCw1gP0dw-U/edit
  - However, at the pay rate, I dont think its worth it. Lots of time to create what they want. Id consider this mainly unfair compared to the others of equal difficulty or lesser difficulty with similar pay.
  - I do admire the amount of information they provide to people who are going to participate in this though. Perhaps I have misread the intention. If I had those maybe id be of a different mindset
- 5 https://worker.mturk.com/requesters/A1Q6SJTRAZEIE6/projects?ref=w_pl_prvw
  -  decent pay and seems relatively easily
  - turns out this is harder than I thought. Definetly requires a good amount of brain power, didnt even pass the qualification test. Fair considering the pay seems good
  - "Clicking map points on a mobile device may be difficult, and you may have better results on a larger device. " Didnt think about this, but doing a lot of these tasks on your mobile on the bus or walking around seems like a good idea.
  - Looking at the images, each click would take some amount of time, even if I can easily identify canopy vs non canopy
  - This seems like it would take much longer than I would want to.
  - Is this fair? I would say no, seems like a lot of work for little result, however it does seem to be for a good cause.
- 6 https://worker.mturk.com/requesters/AG9MJLK2FDMMS/projects?ref=w_pl_prvw
  - This is one I think I would hate. Do some standardized test with a bonus? I dont know if bonuses are common, ive seen a few, but i distrust it immediately
  - if you dont get a bonus, you only get a cent, so im figuring its a way to weed out spammers, but i think it can be abused.
  - unable to preview this, but still an interesting one
- 7 https://worker.mturk.com/requesters/A24RK7QQFRUIT3/projects?ref=w_pl_prvw
  - they want to know about resources in the u.s. What level of detail can they not get from online? Is it like a census for resources? pay is bad tho, i dont like it
  - this is also not previewable :/
- 8 https://worker.mturk.com/requesters/A1ZEEGMU3YMZ6/projects?ref=w_pl_prvw
  - Do i like an indie song or not? thats a good one, should get about .4 cents per second, which is better than a lot ive seen so far
  - In general this seems to be of a particular business platform meant to help "artists improve their music"
  - no longer available as of 10/25/19
- 9 https://worker.mturk.com/requesters/A2OR3N571JOX16/projects?ref=w_pl_prvw
  - It seems weird, you have to do a survey to qualify on a seperate site, but when I finished the survey it said the survey no longer existed. Was it just stealing data?
  - I realized by filling in the survey with bogus values, it rejected my application. Mainly, they wanted food reviews, but I said I never go out to eat. So i guess that makes me no good. The idea is that at the end of the survey you just submit a survey ID and you get paid.
- 10 https://worker.mturk.com/projects/3P1CQ14RI9QVA948KAERJ7AMWXTDB8/tasks?ref=w_pl_prvw
  - Despite the low pay rate, I admire the transparency of these researchers
  - In the realms of fairness, I think this is way up there
  - This survey aims to benefit collegiate athletes transition out of college into the workforce
    -  The purpose of the study is to gain further understanding into ways former collegiate track and field student-athletes make a smooth transition from collegiate sport into the work force.
  - Overall, out of all tasks and surveys ive seen, this is the best one to illustrate what the data is being used for, who it is shared with, for how long, security risks, and what they are doing to help protect it. Even if you dont like what they are going to do with the data, you easily see what and for how long, which many other HITs dont specify
- 11 https://worker.mturk.com/projects/36MWL0IRFB88OX03CVK8VGUUVBFHOH/tasks?ref=w_pl_prvw
  - help label postcards?
  - howto given: https://www.cardcow.com/t/views.html
  - simpler instructions, looks like you just pull info from a post card, such as its location, category, and description
  - a bit involved in the description, it doesnt look like we only transcribe from the card, sometimes need to pull up another source
  - could people outside of the U.S. do this easily?
  - pay is okay, 5$ worth of work in this entire task, might take a half hour?


## Found on oct 24, 2019
For some reason I didnt notice that the person who offers HITs are also rated, you can discover how long it usually takes to receive payments from them, and how often they pass or fail people the tasks they put out (or at least thats what i assume what HIT approval rate means)

## Thoughts when reading fairness principles
I highlighted this thought in my notes,
What is fair for workers
Prompt response times
Paying workers in a timely manner
Experiment to pay workers to download harmful code has lead to mistrust
Biasing workers in the survey responses with a qualifier survey (havent thought of this, its a good point)
“Underpayment of crowd workers is anything less than the current federal minimum wage in the United States. Tasks paying less than this are likely to tap into a highly vulnerable work pool and constitutes coercion.” This is a very good point
Fun fact “Honest US-based turkers will generally be paying taxes on their MTurk earnings as self-employment.”
Sociological experiments such as breaching experiments can sow discord and destroy relationships
Dynamo is a community of turkers seeking to improve conditions of turkers through collective action.
The availability of non-US workers on MTurk has apparently been gradually decreasing since Amazon stopped accepting registrations of new international worker accounts in late 2012. And with the exception of India (the only country besides the US that has ever been able to receive direct monetary payment), there were never a large percentage of workers from any other particular country.

## Exploring Turker Forums
- http://mturkforum.com/index.php?threads/finding-great-hits-10-26-strange-saturday.15277/#post-1695019
- What is a HIT? see below
- users are listing HITs with good hourly rates for each other with a rather positive demeanor.
- "I've been out for a couple hours but the requester had messaged me back and said, "yes, the survey is full". Why he doesn't pull it off the board is beyond me. "
  - Not something i thought of, but probably a pretty interesting interaction with HIT catchers!
-https://www.reddit.com/r/mturk/comments/7reuka/what_exactly_is_hit_catcher/
  - A hit catcher will automatically keep track of a particular HIT id and accept it a certain number of times for you, thus you can claim that sweet money.
  - once for surveys, or multiple times for batchwork.
  - There is an argument at the bottom where a user claims turkers dont look out for each other, a "dog eat dog world".
- http://mturkforum.com/index.php?threads/finding-great-hits-10-24-toe-tapping-tinkerbell-too-hot-thursday.15275/page-2
  - lots of juicy information here.
  - guy says he was screened out, what does that mean? found the answer on mturk subreddit __see link below__
  - From a user, I saw TV, what is this? A tracking mechanism on time spent? lead me to the link two below this one
  -  "the one from earlier in the week took a half hour. I enjoy them even though its a crap ton of reading. " ~carpy, page 4. Highlights that some do work for fun sometimes
- https://www.reddit.com/r/mturk/comments/4wuaf7/survey_screening_im_practically_guaranteed_to_be/
  - plenty of surveys seem to screenout users who do not differ enough from the demographics they are interested in
  - Is this fair?  I spent the time investing in a survey just to get turned around and not get paid at all?
  - reddit users seem to agree it isnt fair
  - argument inside about demographics
  - "level 1

    I get screened out about 40% of the time.. A couple of years ago, when I first joined mturk, I got screened out of everything, but back then you'd get like a penny or two for the trouble. I ended up making about a dollar before I gave up and wondered why everybody was always claiming it to be the best way to make money online. I don't remember there being "batches" either, unless they were just harder to find back then. Seems like it was mostly surveys.

    I decided to try again about 2 weeks ago and it has definitely changed from what I remember it being. Except now if you don't qualify for a survey, you don't get anything."
- http://mturkforum.com/index.php?help/terms
  - The forum has a terms of service that highlights good practices on the turkers part
  - dont do HITs while intoxicated
  - dont scam requesters,
  -  overall good principles

- https://turkerview.com/requesters/AU24HLF1E5CG5
  - This site seems to keep stats on requesters and some reviews about them.-
  - This is what TV stands for! https://www.reddit.com/r/mturk/comments/c3yfut/is_tv_worth_the_cost/
Common HIT catchers is PandA .

    I've found it invaluable, not only for all the info available, but for the sense that we're all in this together, the camaraderie, & worker well being. It's as close as we'll ever get to a union of workers. The more people join, and pay, the more strength the workers wield against the less than desirable requesters.

    You might also consider following on Twitter (where the requesters chat among themselves) for a viable workers' social media presence is only to our benefit.
    - I like this quote a lot. It shows that its much mroe than the money, its about the online community you work with. Its beautiful.
  - You can pay for particular features on turkey view?
  - can also help by donating information
- https://turkerview.com/qualifeye/
  - page with information on the common qualifying surveys you can do for AMT in your free time.
  - seems really helpful, nice to see these resources
