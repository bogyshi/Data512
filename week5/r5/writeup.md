# Notes:

This last mile paradox, i think is supposed to mimic platos paradox, or whoever it was that said if you were to try and chase a turtle by getting halfway between where you were and the turtle every second, youd never actually catch it.

I like this analogy better, as even if we open up __more__ jobs than what we closed with some technology, are these people getting paid more? are they working less hours? will they get insurance and other benefits? I doubt it, and thus quality of human life will go down as we make it easier for humans to accomplish these "backfills" of computer error

Which Reading?:  Ghost Work: How to Stop Silicon Valley from Building a New Global Underclass.

## How does this reading inform your understanding of human centered data science?

Learning about the people behind the various technologies that are powered by data that we use daily is enlightening. Keeping in mind that there is a gap where our algorithms fall short and we need human input is good in both the business sense and a practical sense. Knowing that there are people executing these jobs without necessarily knowing what for  is fascinating. If we ever find ourselves in a position managing some service needing some gaps filled, we should keep in mind that it may be outsourced to online crowdwork platforms and think if its appropriate to do so.

## One question that came to mind.
Highlighted in my notes previously, the author has a seemingly optimistic view on the automation of tasks, thinking it will potentially create this utopia of microtasks where people seemingly jump online and work on what they want to work when they want to, rather than sitting at a desk. Its a lovely image, but I do not think its reasonable, as the work will become increasingly menial rather than complex. Further, even if it were to need some training, it wouldnt be much (as shown by AMT HITs as it stands). What will we do when we are paid fractions of a penny, and receive no health insurance or other benefits while working these self-employed gigs?
