# Notes:

This last mile paradox, i think is supposed to mimic platos paradox, or whoever it was that said if you were to try and chase a turtle by getting halfway between where you were and the turtle every second, youd never actually catch it.

I like this analogy better, as even if we open up __more__ jobs than what we closed with some technology, are these people getting paid more? are they working less hours? will they get insurance and other benefits? I doubt it, and thus quality of human life will go down as we make it easier for humans to accomplish these "backfills" of computer error
