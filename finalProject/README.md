## Smart Meter Analysis
## Author: Alexander Van Roijen

### Abstract
This folder demonstrates the cumulative learnings of the human centered data science course applied to a data analysis project on smart meter data in the U.K.
Results shown in the SmartMeterResults notebook demonstrate significant savings in energy for ToU households and attempts to predict future consumption with only prior signals as input using SINDy.

This README simply serves as a description of the files present in this folder of the repository.

In the analyses folder you will find the smartMeterAnalyses.ipynb notebook that contains the workflow to generate the results highlighted in SmartMeterResults.ipynb

In the data folder you will find the raw data, as well as formatted data generated by the smartMeterAnalyses.ipynb notebook
However it also includes the sepData.py script that is used by the same notebook to clean and parse the data as a helper library

The images folder contains the graphics included in the results notebook.

proposal.md is an artifact of earlier editions of this project that highlights my initial goals of this project.

Demand Response and Smart Meters.pdf is a presentation of the results from this project.
