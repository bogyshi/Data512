## Things I can do better next time

- Round numbers when appropriate
- Dont include data that is meaningless overall or not relevant to the context 
- Number or label tables in the text
- Make sure units remain specified

## One last note:
keep in mind that nice pictures, documentation, and concise results builds up trust and lets people feel they can trust in me for future successful projects and analysis
