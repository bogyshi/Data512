Reflection 1:
The Dollar-And-Cents Case Against Hollywoodâ€™s Exclusion of Women
Walt Hickey

How does this reading inform your understanding of human centered data science?

This reading demonstrates a data journalism approach to human centered data science. It is a process of validating preconceived notions of actresses and women in films in cinema. This article demonstrated the beginnings on quantifying a preconceived idea that films with focus on women tend to under perform in revenue as compared to male-centric films. It accomplishes this task by quantifying this notion using the Bechdel test. In my head, this is the beginning of data science in a human centered fashion. There is a clear concern for inequity of women in film (which is important not just for women trying to make money acting, but also for children who may look for role models in cinema). There is then analysis done to try and understand in a statistically rigorous manner whether the decision makers in hollywood are making the right decision not just for diversity sake, but also monetarily. The end goal of this being to, in my mind, begin deeper discussions in the upper echelons of movie producers to rethink their assumptions of how world wide audiences perceive female dominated films. Overall, this article begins the process of tackling a socio-economic issue using data to drive intelligent discussion, which is then followed up by Brian Keegan's article.

One question that came to mind.
Can we extend a similar analysis to TV? Younger audiences are often watching tv, or even youtube channels with increasing frequency. Perhaps we might see a different situation there that may impact the future of cinema? I ask this because it seems like another good corollary to study in relation to this subject.


Reflection 2:
The Need for Openness in Data Journalism
Brian Keegan

How does this reading inform your understanding of human centered data science?
Brian Keegan takes an in depth approach to recreate the analysis done by Walt Hickey. The purpose being to provide and emphasize the need for replicability in data journalism. This is another stage of the cycle that is the human centered data science process. Walt introduces a subject of enquiry with significant impact to society at large and is then discussed and developed upon by Brian Keegan. The continuation of this work at large is crucial to the remainder of this process as we continue to dig deeper and better understand the biases in Hollywood and why its important to address them.

To Brian Keegan's point, this discussion he made should not require as much effort and as many liberties for the general public in order to better develop this human centered design process. This would be achieved if Walt had better documented his code and data wrangling process.

One question that came to mind.
During one point in his analysis, Keegan says "However, we can put away the pitchforks because although there is a negative relationship between Bechdel scores and MetaCritic scores, it is not statistically significant."

Keegan later says: "Even after controlling for everything in the "kitchen sink" model, compared to similar movies that pass none of the requirements, movies passing the Bechdel test (the red bars):    
- Receive budgets that are 24% smaller
- Make 55% more revenue
- Are awarded 1.8 more Metacritic points by professional reviewers
- Are awarded 0.12 fewer stars by IMDB's amateur reviewers

So I am confused by what seems to be contradicting views on the data, how did he come to this conclusion?
